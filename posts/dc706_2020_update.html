                <h1>DC706 2020 Update - Meetings and More</h1>
                <br/>
                <p>It has been some time since we have updated the site with any content. This is because when this year started quite a few things occurred.</p> 
                <p>First off we were in the process of considering switching all our website functionality to relying on the DEFCON Group forums. This isn't off the table, but for the time being this effort has been halted and the website is here to stay.
                    We still have to consider the features and trade offs as it is possible we will desire to use both platforms in the future rather than just substituting one for the other. </p>
                <p>The second thing that occurred was of course the global pandemic causing us to shift all our meetings to be online. Due to the nature of the online meetings it has been difficult to keep a record of them on our website, and there is often no real need to add a listing as they are always at the same time, in the same place.</p>
                <p>As we move into 2021 we will consider how often we will continue to update the meetings page on the site, but for now it makes sense to have this public post informing everyone how they can get updates around meetings regardless of the status of our main site.
                    The first is of course by navigating on over to the <a href="../comms">COMMS page</a> on our site and joining our Discord. This is where all our remote meetings occur, and where we all keep in touch during these remote heavy times.
                    The second is by joining our mailing list. You'll still need to be a part of the Discord to participate in meetings, but the mailing list is a great way to receive notifications about DC706 activities if Discord notificaitons aren't your thing.
                    You can access the mailing list by signing up here: <a href="https://forms.gle/MHvYkHQjWghYrTpAA">https://forms.gle/MHvYkHQjWghYrTpAA</a></p>
                <p>Come hang out and hack with us, we'd love to have you!</p>
