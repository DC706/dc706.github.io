             <p>DC706 follows the simplified standard that is set by the security BSides conferences for our Code of Conudct, it is as follows:
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 DC706 has NO TOLERANCE for physical/verbal/sexual harassment of any human, humanoid, or AI! Our “Code of Conduct” is “Be Excellent to Each Other” AKA the Golden Rule. 
                 Failing that, it is “Do not be an Ass* or we will kick your ass out!“. Asking questions of a speaker during their talk to get clarity, or debate a point is NOT being an ass – heckling or haranguing the speaker IS. 
                 If you are not sure, ask, or err on the side of basic decency and common courtesy. If what they are doing would not be acceptable to have done to you, your best friend, your worst enemy, your sister, niece, daughter, brother, nephew, son, mother, father, or any human being, do not let them treat anyone else that way – whether you know them or not. 
                 If someone asks you to stop – stop. If you are having an issue with a DC706 participant of ANY type, find an organizer. They will assist you in determining the next steps for you to feel safe and heard. 
                 <i>*Staff reserves the right to determine what constitutes “Being an Ass”.</i></p>
