            <p>The next DC706 meeting will be on January 25, 2020 at Midtown Coffee in Columbus, GA. DC706 meetings will be a casual affair with no membership dues. All skill levels welcomed and encouraged. The plan for the this meeting is to have a small lockpick village and Network King of the Hill (NetKotH) competition. Locks and lockpicks will be available for the village, but feel free to bring your own. Do bring your own laptop to compete in the NetKotH competition. This meeting will be a fun interactive talk where 3ndG4me will walk us through building a C2 implant from scratch. The goal is to teach some new tooling techniques to our offensive community while exposing all of these techniques to those in our defense community so there is something for everyone to learn from and discuss. Come and hang out!
